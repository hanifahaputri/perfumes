#  Unlocking Perfume Trends: Data Analysis of Scents and Popular Notes
## Introduction
In the dynamic and ever-evolving fragrance industry, staying attuned to consumer preferences is essential for success. This business analysis case focuses on studying the data of trending perfumes, leveraging available brand, name, and notes information. By analyzing this data, companies can gain insights into popular scent profiles and make informed decisions about product development and marketing strategies.

## Aim
A perfume retailer seeks to gain a competitive advantage by understanding the trends in perfume preferences among consumers. With access to brand, name, and notes data, they aim to uncover the most popular scent profiles, identify emerging fragrance trends, and make strategic decisions to enhance their product offerings.

## Methods
### Data Scope & Methodology
The analysis draws data from [Fragrantica](https://fragrantica.com/), covering the years 2018 to 2022 and focusing on the top ten fragrances based on user votes. The dataset includes various fragrance categories and requires manual entry due to the lack of a downloadable CSV file on Fragrantica's website. The information encompasses brand, name, and fragrance notes. This approach allows for a nuanced exploration of evolving fragrance trends across genders during the specified period.

In this project, I used a methodical approach to parse and extract data from Fragrantica using Jupyter Notebook. To ensure cleanliness and significance, raw data was first collected and then cleaned using Python. The cleaned data were then imported into Tableau for visualisation, which required iterative design refinement to achieve clarity and visual appeal. The final Tableau visualisations were helpful in extracting useful information from the cleaned data. To guarantee the openness and accuracy of results, the whole process, from data collection and preprocessing to visualisation design, was documented and can be accessed.

## Reflections & Limitations
Between 2018 and 2022, this study delved into scent preferences based on gender, focusing on long-term patterns. Understanding Tableau was straightforward due to its user-friendly nature. However, the Tableau Public version had limitations, lacking flexibility and comprehensive documentation. Challenges arose from Fragrantica's data, which lacked a downloadable CSV file and required manual entry. These obstacles shed light on the complexities of working with diverse data sources, offering insights into the learning process and practical considerations. The gender-based approach facilitated analyzing preferences among different gender groups, providing a comprehensive grasp of scent popularity and the role of gender in fragrance selection.
